Development of an intelligent mobile application using android studio based on deep learning ensuring the rescue of human lives during a road accident.
The dataset attributs include 3-axis acceleration (accx, accy, accz) of the accelemeter which is a motion sensor in smartphones and the the is a binary class that detects if it's an accident or not (0 & 1).
Our problem is a classification problem .
I started with the preprocessing of the data going to the data splitting and training .
I chose to work on the tensorflow platform, I used the sequential model keras.
